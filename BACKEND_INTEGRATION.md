## 🔧 Backend Integration Guide

### 1. API Endpoints Required

The frontend expects the following REST API endpoints:

#### Daybook Entries
```
GET    /api/entries                    # Get all entries
GET    /api/entries/:id               # Get single entry
POST   /api/entries                   # Create new entry
PUT    /api/entries/:id               # Update entry
DELETE /api/entries/:id               # Delete entry
DELETE /api/entries/bulk              # Bulk delete entries
GET    /api/entries/search            # Search entries
GET    /api/entries/export/csv        # Export to CSV
GET    /api/entries/validate-voucher  # Validate voucher number
```

#### Reports
```
GET    /api/reports/templates         # Get report templates
GET    /api/reports/trial-balance     # Generate trial balance
GET    /api/reports/profit-loss       # Generate P&L report
GET    /api/reports/cash-flow         # Generate cash flow report
```

#### Account Categories
```
GET    /api/categories                # Get all categories
POST   /api/categories                # Create category
PUT    /api/categories/:id            # Update category
DELETE /api/categories/:id            # Delete category
```

#### Settings
```
GET    /api/settings                  # Get user settings
PUT    /api/settings                  # Update settings
POST   /api/settings/reset            # Reset to defaults
GET    /api/settings/export           # Export all data
POST   /api/settings/import           # Import data
```

#### Dashboard
```
GET    /api/dashboard/summary         # Get summary statistics
```

### 2. Data Models

Refer to `src/types/daybook.ts` for complete TypeScript interfaces that match the expected JSON structure:

- `DaybookEntry`: Main entry model
- `SummaryData`: Dashboard statistics
- `UserSettings`: Application settings
- `ReportTemplate`: Report configuration
- And more...

### 3. Authentication (Optional)

The frontend includes commented authentication interceptors in `api.ts`. Uncomment and modify as needed:

```typescript
// Uncomment in api.ts for JWT authentication
api.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

### 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_COMPANY_NAME=Your Company Name
```

### 5. Current Dummy Data

The frontend currently uses dummy data in `api.ts` with:
- 15 sample daybook entries
- 5 account categories
- 5 report templates
- Complete user settings

All API calls are simulated with realistic delays and responses.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## 📊 Sample Data Structure

### Daybook Entry
```json
{
  "_id": "1",
  "date": "2025-06-30",
  "particulars": "Office Supplies Purchase",
  "voucherNumber": "V001",
  "debit": 250.00,
  "credit": 0,
  "createdAt": "2025-06-30T08:00:00.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-06-30T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Summary Data
```json
{
  "today": { "debit": 250.00, "credit": 1500.00 },
  "week": { "debit": 2430.00, "credit": 5500.00 },
  "month": { "debit": 3885.00, "credit": 11325.00 }
}
```

## 🔄 Backend Integration Steps

1. **Review API Calls**: Check `src/services/api.ts` for all expected endpoints
2. **Update Base URL**: Uncomment and configure the axios base URL
3. **Implement Endpoints**: Create corresponding backend routes
4. **Test Integration**: Replace dummy functions with real API calls
5. **Handle Errors**: Implement proper error handling and loading states
6. **Authentication**: Add JWT or session-based auth if required

## 📝 Notes for Backend Developers

- All monetary values are stored as numbers (not strings)
- Dates are in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Voucher numbers should be unique
- The frontend handles pagination, sorting, and filtering client-side currently
- Export functionality expects binary data (Blob objects)
- All API responses should follow the `ApiResponse<T>` interface structure

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Dark/light theme support
- Loading states and error messages
- Form validation with user feedback
- Confirmation modals for destructive actions
- Real-time search and filtering
- Data export functionality
- Print-friendly report layouts
