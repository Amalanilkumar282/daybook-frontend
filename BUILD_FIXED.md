# âœ… BUILD ERRORS FIXED

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the build error that was preventing successful compilation:

```
Syntax error: The `2xl:max-w-8xl` class does not exist. 
If `2xl:max-w-8xl` is a custom class, make sure it is defined within a `@layer` directive.
```

## Solution Applied
Added missing `maxWidth` utilities to `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
maxWidth: {
  '8xl': '88rem',    // ~1408px
  '9xl': '96rem',    // ~1536px  
  '10xl': '104rem',  // ~1664px
},
```

## Build Status
âœ… **Build successful!** 
- `npm run build` - âœ… Compiled successfully
- `npm run start` - âœ… Development server running
- File sizes optimized and ready for deployment

## Files Updated
- `tailwind.config.js` - Added missing maxWidth utilities

## Verification
- No TypeScript errors
- No CSS compilation errors  
- No linting errors
- Production build ready for deployment
